Apple
=====

The **apple** is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species ***Malus
domestica*** in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is one of the most widely
cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of genus
Malus that are used by humans. Apples grow on small, deciduous trees. The tree
originated in Western Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still
found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe,
and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have been
present in the mythology and religions of many cultures, including Norse, Greek
and Christian traditions. In 2010, the fruit's genome was decoded, leading to
new understandings of disease control and selective breeding in apple
production.
