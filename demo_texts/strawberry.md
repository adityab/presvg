Strawberry
==========

The **garden strawberry, Fragaria × ananassa**, is a hybrid species that is
cultivated worldwide for its fruit, the (common) **strawberry**. The fruit
(which is not actually a berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely
appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and
sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in prepared
foods such as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, and milkshakes.
Artificial strawberry aroma is also widely used in many industrialized food
products.
